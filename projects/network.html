            <ul>
              <li><strong>Skills Used and Learned</strong>: Python, Golang, SQL, Protocol Buffers, Data Analysis.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In this project, I took on the responsibility of designing and implementing a sophisticated software
              system tailored for the analysis of extensive datasets representing network paths. The primary objective
              was to enhance the detection capabilities for misbehaving network components, by finding the connection
              drop rate, connection breakage rate, expected time to breakage, and load distribution of the network. </p>
            <p>
              The software I developed incorporated advanced algorithms and analytical techniques to extract valuable
              insights from the large dataset. One of the key features of the system was its ability to assess metrics
              critical to network performance. One of the metrics is connection drop rate, which quantifies the
              frequency of connections being terminated prematurely. Additionally, the software calculated the
              connection breakage rate, providing insights into the occurrences of connection disruptions. </p>
            <p>
              A significant contribution of the project was the incorporation of the expected time to breakage metric.
              This metric provided a predictive element, estimating the anticipated duration until a network path
              experiences a disruption. Such predictive capabilities can be invaluable in proactively addressing
              potential issues before they escalate. </p>

            <p>
              Moreover, the software had the capability to analyze and visualize the load distribution across all
              network devices within the dataset of network paths. This feature offered a comprehensive understanding of
              how network traffic was distributed among various components, aiding in optimizing load balancing
              strategies. </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the course of this project, I gained invaluable insights and skills in various domains. The
              utilization of Python as the primary programming language allowed me to harness its versatility in
              handling data processing tasks efficiently. SQL was instrumental in querying and managing the large
              dataset. Engaging in extensive data analysis as part of this project deepened my understanding of network
              behaviors, load balancing dynamics, and the significance of key metrics in evaluating network health.
              Additionally, I learned to navigate the complexities associated with large-scale datasets, applying
              advanced analytical techniques to derive actionable insights. Overall, this project not only honed my
              technical skills but also provided practical experience in addressing real-world challenges within the
              realm of network analysis and optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, through the design and implementation of this software, I aimed to provide a robust and effective
              solution for the analysis of network paths, enabling the identification of misbehaving components and
              contributing to the refinement of Google's network load balancing mechanisms. </p>
